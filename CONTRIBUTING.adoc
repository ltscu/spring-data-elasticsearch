= Spring Data contribution guidelines

You find the contribution guidelines for Spring Data projects https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-build/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc[here].

== Running the test locally

In order to run the tests locally with `./mvnw test` you need to have docker running because Spring Data Elasticsearch uses https://www.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers] to start a local running Elasticsearch instance.
